Hello, my name is Zhandra Prayer and I am an eighteen year old  incoming freshman at Tougaloo College. My intended major is Biology with a concentration in Pre-Medicine. I am originally from the Delta but specifically Greenwood,Mississippi. I was raised in a single-parent home. I recently graduated from Amanda Elzy High School within the top five.  I was very athletic in high school by participating as a varsity cheerleader for five consecutive years and a track and field member for two consecutive years.
